# <a src="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_pr_aspect-ratio.php">aspect-ratio</a>

This property allows you to define the ratio between width and height of an element. If `aspect-ratio` and `width` properties are set, the height will follow in the defined aspect ratio. We generally use the `aspect-ratio` property in responsive layouts where elements often vary in size and you want to preserve the ratio between width and height.

<b style="color: Chartreuse;">HEIGHT = WIDTH / ASPECT-RATIO</b>

```
aspect-ratio: <width> / <height>;
```

Example: Aspect-ratio of 3/2 and width set to 100px makes height 2/3 of width.

# <a src="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_text_white-space.php">white-space</a>

The `white-space` CSS property controls how whitespace (spaces, tabs, and line breaks) is handled in an element. It determines whether text / elements wraps onto the next line or remains on a single line.

```css
white-space: normal | nowrap | pre | pre-wrap | pre-line | break-spaces;
```

<u>**IMPORTANT VALS**</u>

- `normal`:	Sequences of whitespace will collapse into a single whitespace. Text will wrap when necessary. This is default	
- `nowrap`:	Sequences of whitespace will collapse into a single whitespace. Text will never wrap to the next line. The text continues on the same line until a `<br>` tag is encountered
