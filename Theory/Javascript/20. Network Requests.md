The Fetch API is a modern JavaScript interface for making network requests (HTTP requests) in web browsers and Node.js environments. It provides a more powerful and flexible way to perform asynchronous communication with web servers compared to older APIs like XMLHttpRequest (XHR).

The main function of the Fetch API is to fetch resources (such as JSON data, HTML pages, images, etc.) from a network.
It uses the fetch() method, which takes a URL as its first argument and returns a Promise that resolves to the Response object representing the response to the request. It uses the <b style="color: Violet;">fetch()</b> method, which takes a URL as its first argument and returns a Promise that resolves to the Response object representing the response to the request.

Fetch API is promise-based, meaning it uses Promises to handle asynchronous operations. You can use `.then()` and .`catch()` methods (or `async-await`) to handle success and error responses respectively.

<h4>Syntax</h4>

```js
fetch(url [, options])
  .then(response => {
    // Handle response
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // Handle error
  });
```

- <b style="color: Chartreuse;">url:</b> The URL to access.
- <b style="color: Chartreuse;">Request Object:</b> Represents the request to be made. It allows you to customize various aspects of the request such as headers, method, body, etc.
- <b style="color: Chartreuse;">Response Object:</b> Represents the response received from the server. It provides methods and properties to access response data such as status, headers, body, etc.

Example request:

```js
const mockApiCall = async () => {
  try {
    let url = "https://06f36437b00f4150b9892f52f5af15ad.api.mockbin.io/";
    let response = await fetch(url);
    let data = await response.json(); // To get body of response
    console.log({ data });
  } catch (error) {
    console.log("Error occured: ", error);
  }
};

mockApiCall();
```

# Response

- <b style="color: Salmon;">response.status</b>: Response status code
- <b style="color: Salmon;">response.ok</b>: `true` if the status is `200-299`. <b style="color:red;">(Most used)</b>
- <b style="color: Salmon;">response.headers</b>: Map-like object with HTTP headers.
- <b style="color: Salmon;">response.text()</b>: Return the response as text.
- <b style="color: Salmon;">response.json()</b>: Parse the response as JSON object. <b style="color:red;">(Most used)</b>
- <b style="color: Salmon;">response.formData()</b>: Return the response as FormData object (multipart/form-data encoding, see the next chapter).
- <b style="color: Salmon;">response.blob()</b>: Return the response as Blob (binary data with type).
- <b style="color: Salmon;">response.arrayBuffer()</b>: Return the response as ArrayBuffer (low-level binary data).

<h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid white; padding-bottom: 2px; display: inline-block;">Status</h3>

HTTP response status codes (or simply status codes) are 3-digit codes issued by server in response to browser-side request from a client. These status codes serve as a means of quick and concise communication on how the server worked on and responded to the client's request.

Some famous codes are:

- <span style="color: Red;">404 Not Found</span>: This status code indicates that the server can’t find anything matching the Request-URI. Links that lead to a 404 page are often called broken or dead links
- <span style="color: Orange;">500 Internal Server Error</span>: This status code indicates that the server encountered an unexpected condition which prevented it from fulfilling the request.
- <span style="color: DarkOrange;">501 Not Implemented</span>: This status code means that the server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request.
- <span style="color: HotPink;">401 Unauthorized</span>: This status code indicates that the request has not been applied because it lacks valid authentication credentials for the target resource. This status is sent with a WWW-Authenticate header that contains information on how to authorize correctly. With this status code, it is possible to repeat the request by including authentication in order to access the target resource. This status is similar to `403 Forbidden`, but in this case, authentication is possible.
- <span style="color: LawnGreen;">200 OK</span>: This status code indicates that the request has succeeded.

<h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid white; padding-bottom: 2px; display: inline-block;">Response Headers</h3>

HTTP response headers are key-value pairs sent by a server in response to a client's HTTP request. These headers provide additional information about the requested resource, how it should be handled, and how the client and server should interact. Response headers are an integral part of both HTTP request and response messages, but they do not directly pertain to the data contained within the message body. Instead, they provide metadata about the response's handling and transmission.

Here's an overview of some common HTTP response headers:

- <b style="color: Khaki;">Status-Line</b>: This is not technically a header but rather the initial line of the response that includes the HTTP version, status code, and reason phrase. For example: `HTTP/1.1 200 OK`
- <b style="color: Khaki;">Date</b>: Indicates the date and time when the response was generated by the server.
- <b style="color: Khaki;">Server</b>: Specifies information about the server software that generated the response.
- <b style="color: Khaki;">Content-Type</b>: Specifies the media type (MIME type) of the response body. For example, `text/html`, `application/json`, `image/jpeg`, etc.
- <b style="color: Khaki;">Content-Length</b>: Indicates the size of the response body in bytes.
- <b style="color: Khaki;">Content-Encoding</b>: Specifies the encoding applied to the response body, such as `gzip`, `deflate`, or `br` (Brotli).
- <b style="color: Khaki;">Content-Language</b>: Specifies the natural language(s) of the intended audience for the enclosed content.
- <b style="color: Khaki;">Cache-Control</b>: Directives for caching mechanisms in both requests and responses. It can control caching on client-side caches, intermediary proxies, and the server itself.
- <b style="color: Khaki;">ETag</b>: A unique identifier for the version of the requested resource, used for cache validation and conditional requests.
- <b style="color: Khaki;">Expires</b>: Specifies the date/time after which the response is considered stale and should not be used.
- <b style="color: Khaki;">Last-Modified</b>: Indicates the date and time when the requested resource was last modified.
- <b style="color: Khaki;">Location</b>: Used in redirections (status codes 3xx) to indicate the URL to which the client should redirect.
- <b style="color: Khaki;">Set-Cookie</b>: Sets a cookie on the client's browser. Used for session management, tracking, and authentication.
- <b style="color: Khaki;">WWW-Authenticate</b>: Indicates the authentication scheme(s) the server supports and the realm for which authentication is required.
- <b style="color: Khaki;">Allow</b>: Specifies the HTTP methods supported by the resource.
- <b style="color: Khaki;">Access-Control-Allow-Origin</b>: Used in Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to specify which origins are allowed to access the resource.
- <b style="color: Khaki;">Strict-Transport-Security</b>: Instructs the browser to only access the site over HTTPS for a specified duration.

# Request Object

Here’s the full list of all possible fetch options with their default values (alternatives in comments):

```js
let promise = fetch(url, {
  method: "GET", // POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
  headers: {
    // the content type header value is usually auto-set
    // depending on the request body
    "Content-Type": "text/plain;charset=UTF-8",
  },
  body: undefined, // string, FormData, Blob, BufferSource, or URLSearchParams
  // or an url from the current origin
  referrerPolicy: "strict-origin-when-cross-origin", // no-referrer-when-downgrade, no-referrer, origin, same-origin...
  mode: "cors", // same-origin, no-cors
  credentials: "same-origin", // omit, include
  cache: "default", // no-store, reload, no-cache, force-cache, or only-if-cached
  redirect: "follow", // manual, error
  integrity: "", // a hash, like "sha256-abcdef1234567890"
  keepalive: false, // true
  signal: undefined, // AbortController to abort request
  window: window, // null
});
```

<h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid white; padding-bottom: 2px; display: inline-block;">Method</h3>

An HTTP request method, also known as an HTTP verb, is a way to indicate the action that an API client will perform on a resource. Each method is assigned a specific purpose, such as creating, reading, updating, or deleting a resource. Request methods are case-sensitive and should always be noted in upper case.

Some popular HTTP methods include:

- <b style="color: Violet;">GET</b>: Used to read/retrieve data from a web server. GET returns an HTTP status code of 200 (OK) if the data is successfully retrieved from the server.
- <b style="color: Violet;">POST</b>: Used to send data (file, form data, etc.) to the server. On successful creation, it returns an HTTP status code of 201.
- <b style="color: Violet;">PUT</b>: Used to modify the data on the server. It replaces the entire content at a particular location with data that is passed in the body payload. If there are no resources that match the request, it will generate one.
- <b style="color: Violet;">PATCH</b>: It is similar to PUT request, but the only difference is, it modifies a part of the data. It will only replace the conten</b>t that you want to update.
- <b style="color: Violet;">DELETE</b>: Used to delete the data on the server at a specified location.

Without options(no second arg), API call is a simple `GET` request, downloading the contents of the `url`.

<h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid white; padding-bottom: 2px; display: inline-block;">Headers</h3>

Request headers are sent by the client to provide additional information about the request being made, which helps the server tailor the response. They can include details such as the client's user agent, the content type of the request body, authentication credentials, and more. Here's a detailed explanation of request headers:

- <b style="color:OliveDrab;">Host</b>: Specifies the domain name of the server being requested. Example: `Host: www.example.com`
- <b style="color:OliveDrab;">User-Agent</b>: Identifies the client making the request, typically the web browser or HTTP client. Example: `User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/97.0.4692.99 Safari/537.36`
- <b style="color:OliveDrab;">Accept</b>: Specifies the media types that the client can understand. Example: `Accept: application/json, text/plain, */*`
- <b style="color:OliveDrab;">Content-Type</b>: Specifies the media type of the request body. Example: `Content-Type: application/json`
- <b style="color:OliveDrab;">Authorization</b>: Provides credentials for authentication. Example (Basic Authentication): `Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=`
- <b style="color:OliveDrab;">Cookie</b>: Contains previously set cookies sent by the server. Example: `Cookie: sessionId=123456789`
- <b style="color:OliveDrab;">Referer</b>: Specifies the URL of the previous web page from which the request was initiated. Example: `Referer: https://www.example.com/page1.html`
- <b style="color:OliveDrab;">Origin</b>: Indicates the origin server of the request (used in CORS). Example: `Origin: https://www.example.com`
- <b style="color:OliveDrab;">Content-Length</b>: Specifies the length of the request body in bytes. Example: `Content-Length: 123`
- <b style="color:OliveDrab;">Accept-Language</b>: Specifies the preferred language of the response content. `Example: Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9`

Clients can also send custom headers to provide additional information or to communicate with specific server-side functionalities. Custom headers are defined by the client and server and are not part of the standard HTTP specification.

```js
X-Custom-Header: Value
```

<h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid white; padding-bottom: 2px; display: inline-block;">Body</h3>

The request body in an HTTP request contains data that is sent from the client (e.g., a web browser or application) to the server. It is used to provide additional information to the server, such as form data, JSON data, file uploads, etc. The structure and content of the request body depend on the HTTP method being used and the specific requirements of the server's API.

It is typically used with "create" and "update" operations, such as `POST`, `PUT`, and `PATCH`. For example, when creating a resource using `POST` or `PUT`, the request body usually contains the representation of the resource to be created.

Request bodies can be of any format, such as JSON, XML, PDF, or Http Forms. The `Content-Type` header indicates the server's understanding type of request. Common media types include `application/json`, `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `multipart/form-data`, etc.

Example:

```js
fetch(url, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ key: "value" }),
});
```

<h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid white; padding-bottom: 2px; display: inline-block;">Referrer Policy</h3>

The Referrer Policy is an HTTP header that allows web developers to control how much referrer information (i.e., the URL of the previous web page) is included in the Referer header of outgoing requests from their site. It provides a way to manage the amount of information shared with other websites when users navigate from one page to another. Referrer Policy helps protect user privacy and security while also enabling developers to customize the behavior of their web applications.

<h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid white; padding-bottom: 2px; display: inline-block;">Mode</h3>

The request `mode` is an option available in the Fetch API that allows you to specify how cross-origin requests are handled. It determines the CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) behavior for the request. The mode affects whether the browser will include certain CORS-related headers and whether cookies and authentication credentials will be sent with the request. The request mode option is particularly useful when making requests to resources on different origins (domains).

<h4>Common Values:</h4>

- <span style="color: Chartreuse;">"cors"</span> – the default, cross-origin requests are allowed, as described in Fetch: Cross-Origin Requests,
- <span style="color: Chartreuse;">"same-origin"</span> – cross-origin requests are forbidden,
- <span style="color: Chartreuse;">"no-cors"</span> – only safe cross-origin requests are allowed.

<h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid white; padding-bottom: 2px; display: inline-block;">Credentials</h3>

The `credentials` option specifies whether `fetch` should send cookies and HTTP-Authorization headers with the request.

- <span style="color: Chartreuse;">"same-origin"</span> – the default, don’t send for cross-origin requests,
- <span style="color: Chartreuse;">"include"</span> – always send, requires Access-Control-Allow-Credentials from cross-origin server in order for JavaScript to access the response, that was covered in the chapter Fetch: Cross-Origin Requests,
- <span style="color: Chartreuse;">"omit"</span> – never send, even for same-origin requests.

<br>

# Cross-Origin Requests

Cross-Origin requests (also known as CORS, which stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) are HTTP requests made from one domain (origin) to another domain. In web development, an "origin" is defined by the combination of the protocol (e.g., `HTTP`, `HTTPS`), domain (e.g., `example.com`), and port (e.g., `:80`, `:443`) of a web page or API endpoint. When a resource (such as a script, stylesheet, or API endpoint) is served from a different origin than the requesting page, it's considered a cross-origin request.

By default, web browsers enforce security policies that restrict cross-origin requests to prevent potential security vulnerabilities, such as CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) and leaking sensitive information.

<h4>To enable cross-origin requests, the server hosting the requested resource must include appropriate CORS headers in its responses. These headers include:</h4>

- <span style="color: Yellow;">Access-Control-Allow-Origin</span>: Specifies which origins are allowed to access the resource. It can be set to a specific origin, "\*", or a list of origins.
- <span style="color: Yellow;">Access-Control-Allow-Methods</span>: Specifies which HTTP methods are allowed when accessing the resource.
- <span style="color: Yellow;">Access-Control-Allow-Headers</span>: Specifies which headers are allowed in the request.
- <span style="color: Yellow;">Access-Control-Allow-Credentials</span>: Indicates whether credentials (such as cookies and authorization headers) can be sent with the request.

<h4>Use Cases for Cross-Origin Requests:</h4>

- Accessing resources from a CDN (Content Delivery Network).
- Consuming APIs from third-party services.
- Embedding resources (such as fonts, scripts, and images) from external sources in web pages.

<b style="color: Red;">Note:</b> Cross-origin requests can introduce security risks if not handled properly. It's essential to implement appropriate security measures and validate incoming requests to prevent attacks such as CSRF and XSS (Cross-Site Scripting).

<br>

# Web Security

<h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid white; padding-bottom: 2px; display: inline-block;">Common security threats in front-end development</h3>

1. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Attackers inject malicious scripts into a webpage, which execute in a user's browser. Can steal cookies, session tokens, or perform actions on behalf of users. Preventions:

   - Use `Content Security Policy (CSP)` to restrict script execution.
   - Sanitize and escape user inputs before rendering them. Use libraries like `DOMPurify` for cleaning input.
   - Use React's `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` sparingly.

2. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** CSRF attacks involve tricking users into performing actions they didn’t intend to take. Attackers exploit the trust that a website has in a user’s browser to execute unauthorized actions.

   - Use `CSRF tokens` (anti-CSRF tokens in forms and headers).
   - Implement SameSite cookie attributes (`Strict` or `Lax`).
   - Require user authentication before performing sensitive actions.

<br>

**-----------------MORE THREATS CAN BE EXPLORED-----------------**

<h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid white; padding-bottom: 2px; display: inline-block;">Some more general preventions</h3>

- Use HTTPS encryption. It ensures secure data transfer, reducing man-in-the-middle risks.
- Protecting against inline scripts is vital for front-end security. These scripts pose a significant risk, as they can execute arbitrary code. The best practice is to separate JavaScript from HTML, using external scripts.
- Never store secrets (API keys, credentials, authentication tokens) in frontend code. Use environment variables on the backend. It will prevent unauthorized access to backend APIs and databases.
- Use secure cookies.

# Real-Time Communication

In the dynamic world of web applications, real-time communication has become a fundamental requirement. Whether it's keeping users updated with live data, facilitating instant messaging, or enabling collaborative features, various methods are employed to achieve real-time communication between clients and servers.

This article delves into four distinct approaches:

1. Short Polling
2. Long Polling
3. Server Sent Events
4. Web Sockets

<h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid white; padding-bottom: 2px; display: inline-block;">1. Short Polling</h3>

Short polling is a technique where the client periodically sends HTTP requests (e.g., every few seconds) to the server to check for updates. If there's new data, the server responds; otherwise, the client gets the same or no data and will poll again on the next interval.

```js
setInterval(() => {
  fetch("/api/updates")
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((data) => {
      // Process the data
      console.log("Polled data:", data);
    });
}, 5000); // Poll every 5 seconds
```

**Pros:**

- Simple to Implement: Works with standard HTTP.
- Stateless: Each request is independent.

**Cons:**

- Inefficient: Can create unnecessary network traffic if updates are infrequent.
- High Latency: There might be a delay between when data is available and when the client fetches it.

**When to use:**

Best for scenarios where updates are infrequent and delays are acceptable. For example: A weather app checking for updates every minute, checking email notifications every 2 minutes, etc.

<h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid white; padding-bottom: 2px; display: inline-block;">2. Long Polling</h3>

Long polling is an enhanced version of polling. The client sends a request to the server, and instead of responding immediately, the server holds the connection open until new data is available. Once the client receives a response, it immediately sends a new request.

<span style="color: Orange;">Long Polling is a fallback technique for environments without WebSocket or SSE support.</span>

```js
function longPoll() {
  fetch("/api/long-poll")
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((data) => {
      console.log("Received data:", data);
      // Process the data and then immediately re-establish the long poll
      longPoll();
    })
    .catch((err) => {
      console.error("Long poll error:", err);
      setTimeout(longPoll, 5000); // Retry after a delay on error
    });
}

longPoll(); // Initiate long polling
```

**Pros:**

- Reduced Latency: The server pushes data as soon as it’s available.
- Less Overhead: Fewer requests compared to short polling when data is updated irregularly.

**Cons:**

- Resource Intensive on the Server: Many open connections might strain server resources.
- More Complex: Requires handling connection timeouts and re-establishing connections.

**When to use:**

- Applications that need near real-time updates without implementing full-duplex communication.
- Chat applications or live feeds with moderate update frequency.

<h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid white; padding-bottom: 2px; display: inline-block;">3. Server-Sent Events (SSE)</h3>

Server-Sent Events (SSE) allow the server to push text-based event data to the client over a single, long-lived HTTP connection. This is a one-way channel from the server to the client. The client opens an `EventSource` connection to a specified URL, and the server sends events whenever new data is available.

```js
const eventSource = new EventSource("/api/events");

eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
  console.log("New event:", event.data);
};

eventSource.onerror = (err) => {
  console.error("EventSource failed:", err);
};
```

**Pros:**

- Built-in Reconnection: The browser automatically reconnects if the connection is lost.
- Lightweight: Uses a single HTTP connection. Reduces the need for repeated requests, saving bandwidth and reducing latency.
- Simple API: The `EventSource` API is easy to use for unidirectional updates.

**Cons:**

- One-Way Communication: Only the server can push data; the client cannot send messages over the same connection.
- Limited to Text: Mainly supports text/event-stream, not binary data.
- Browser Support: Widely supported but not available in some older browsers (polyfills may be needed).

**When to use:**

- For live notifications, stock tickers, news feeds, or other cases where only the server needs to push updates.
- When you want a simpler alternative to WebSockets for unidirectional data flow.

<h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid white; padding-bottom: 2px; display: inline-block;">4. Web Sockets</h3>

WebSockets provide a full-duplex, bidirectional communication channel over a single, persistent TCP connection. Both the client and the server can send messages independently of each other. After an initial HTTP handshake, the connection is upgraded to a WebSocket connection, allowing real-time data flow in both directions.

```js
const socket = new WebSocket("ws://example.com/socket");

socket.addEventListener("open", () => {
  console.log("WebSocket connection established");
  socket.send("Hello, Server!");
});

socket.addEventListener("message", (event) => {
  console.log("Message from server:", event.data);
});

socket.addEventListener("close", () => {
  console.log("WebSocket connection closed");
});
```

**Pros:**

- Real-Time: Enables very low-latency communication.
- Bidirectional: Both client and server can push data anytime.
- Efficient: Uses a single persistent connection for continuous communication.

**Cons:**

- WebSockets don’t automatically recover when connections are terminated – this is something you need to implement yourself, and is part of the reason why there are many client-side libraries in existence.
- Complexity: Requires more sophisticated server setup and connection management.
- Resource Usage: Long-lived connections can be resource-intensive if not managed properly.
- Security: Needs careful handling of connection security and potential attack vectors.

**When to use:**

- Applications requiring true real-time interactivity, like chat apps, multiplayer games, or collaborative tools (like document editing by multiple users)
- Scenarios where both client and server need to frequently exchange data.
