<div style="font-size: 17px;background: black;padding: 2rem;">

JavaScript is a dynamic language with dynamic types. Variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type, and any variable can be assigned (and re-assigned) values of all types:

```js
let foo = 42; // foo is now a number
foo = "bar"; // foo is now a string
foo = true; // foo is now a boolean
```

JavaScript is also a weakly typed language, which means it allows implicit type conversion when an operation involves mismatched types, instead of throwing type errors.

```js
const foo = 42; // foo is a number
const result = foo + "1"; // JavaScript coerces foo to a string, so it can be concatenated with the other operand
console.log(result); // 421
```

Implicit coercions are very convenient, but can create subtle bugs when conversions happen where they are not expected, or where they are expected to happen in the other direction (for example, string to number instead of number to string). For `symbols` and `BigInts`, JavaScript has intentionally disallowed certain implicit type conversions.

# Primitive Values

<span style="color: Orange;">All types except Object define immutable values represented directly at the lowest level of the language. We refer to values of these types as primitive values.</span>

All primitive types, except `null`, can be tested by the <span style="color: HotPink;">typeof</span> operator. `typeof null` returns `"object"`, so one has to use `=== null` to test for `null`.

All primitive types, except `null` and `undefined`, have their corresponding object wrapper types, which provide useful methods for working with the primitive values. For example, the `Number` object provides methods like `toExponential()`. When a property is accessed on a primitive value, JavaScript automatically wraps the value into the corresponding wrapper object and accesses the property on the object instead. However, accessing a property on `null` or `undefined` throws a `TypeError` exception, which necessitates the introduction of the `optional chaining operator`.

## Null

The `null` value represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is one of JavaScript's primitive values and is treated as `falsy` for boolean operations. The value `null` is written with a literal: `null`. `null` is not an identifier for a property of the global object, like `undefined` can be. Instead, `null` expresses a lack of identification, indicating that a variable points to no object. In APIs, `null` is often retrieved in a place where an object can be expected but no object is relevant.

```js
// foo does not exist. It is not defined and has never been initialized:
foo; //ReferenceError: foo is not defined
```

```js
// foo is known to exist now but it has no type or value:
const foo = null;
foo; //null
```

## Undefined

`undefined` is a property of the global object. That is, it is a variable in global scope. In all non-legacy browsers, `undefined` is a non-configurable, non-writable property. Even when this is not the case, avoid overriding it.

<span style="color: Lime;">Conceptually, `undefined` indicates the absence of a value, while `null` indicates the absence of an object (which could also make up an excuse for `typeof null === "object"`).</span> The language usually defaults to `undefined` when something is devoid of a value:

- A `return` statement with no value (`return;`) implicitly returns `undefined`.
- If a parameter of function, without default value, is not received during function call stores `undefined`.
- Accessing a nonexistent object property (`obj.iDontExist`) returns `undefined`.
- A variable declaration without initialization `(let x;)` implicitly initializes the variable to `undefined`.
- Many methods, such as `Array.prototype.find()` and `Map.prototype.get()`, return `undefined` when no element is found.

<div style="border: 1px solid yellow; padding: 10px; background-color: rgba(103, 114, 230, 0.2);">

`null == undefined` results in **TRUE**. The abstract equality operator (`==`) is designed to perform type coercion and special comparisons between different types. Both of these values are used in JavaScript to represent an absence of a meaningful value. The language designers decided that for loose equality checks (using `==`), these two “empty” values should be considered equivalent. This is meant to simplify checks for missing or empty values.

</div>

## Boolean

The Boolean type represents a logical entity and is inhabited by two values: `true` and `false`. Boolean values are usually used for conditional operations, including ternary operators, `if...else`, `while`, etc.

You would rarely need to explicitly convert something to a boolean value, as JavaScript does this automatically in boolean contexts, so you can use any value as if it's a boolean, based on its <b style="color:violet;">truthiness</b>. You are also encouraged to use `if (condition)` and `if (!condition)` instead of `if (condition === true)` or `if (condition === false)` in your own code so you can take advantage of this convention. However, making sure that values representing conditions are always booleans can help clarify the intent of your code.

For converting non-boolean values to boolean, use `Boolean` as a function or use the `double NOT` operator. Do not use the `Boolean() constructor` with `new`.

```js
const good = Boolean(expression); ✅
const good2 = !!expression; ✅
```

```js
const bad = new Boolean(expression); ❌ // don't use this!
```

This is because all objects, including a `Boolean` object whose wrapped value is `false`, are truthy and evaluate to true in places such as conditional statements.

<b><u>Truthy and Falsy values:</u></b>

- `undefined` turns into `false`.
- `null` turns into `false`.
- `0`, `-0`, and `NaN` turn into `false`; other numbers turn into `true`.
- `0n` turns into `false`; other `BigInts` turn into `true`.
- The empty string `""` turns into `false`; other strings turn into `true`.
- `Symbols` turn into `true`.
- All objects become `true` - that means even `[]` and `{}` are `true`.

## Numbers

The `Number` type is a `double-precision 64-bit binary format IEEE 754` value. It is capable of storing positive floating-point numbers between <span style="color: Gold;">2<sup>-1074</sup> (Number.MIN_VALUE)</span> and <span style="color: Gold;">2<sup>1023</sup> × (2 - 2<sup> -52</sup>) (Number.MAX_VALUE)</span> as well as negative floating-point numbers of the same magnitude, but it can only safely store integers in the range <span style="color: Gold;">-(2<sup>53</sup> − 1) (Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER)</span> to <span style="color: Gold;">2<sup>53</sup> − 1 (Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER)</span>. <i><b><u>Outside this range, JavaScript can no longer safely represent integers; they will instead be represented by a double-precision floating point approximation.</u></b></i> You can check if a number is within the range of safe integers using `Number.isSafeInteger()`.

Values outside the representable range are automatically converted:

- Positive values greater than `Number.MAX_VALUE` are converted to `+Infinity`.
- Positive values smaller than `Number.MIN_VALUE` are converted to `+0`.
- Negative values smaller than `-Number.MAX_VALUE` are converted to `-Infinity`.
- Negative values greater than `-Number.MIN_VALU`E are converted to `-0`.

The Number type has only one value with multiple representations: `0` is represented as both `-0` and `+0` (where `0` is an alias for `+0`). In practice, there is almost no difference between the different representations; for example, `+0` === `-0` is true. However, you are able to notice this when you divide by zero:

```js
console.log(42 / +0); // Infinity
console.log(42 / -0); // -Infinity
```

<span style="color: Lime;">NaN</span> ("Not a Number") is a special kind of number value that's typically encountered when the result of an arithmetic operation cannot be expressed as a number. It is also the only value in JavaScript that is not equal to itself. It is a property of global object. There are five different types of operations that return `NaN`:

- Failed number conversion (e.g. explicit ones like `parseInt("blabla")`, `Number(undefined)`, or implicit ones like `Math.abs(undefined)`).
- Math operation where the result is not a real number (e.g. `Math.sqrt(-1)`).
- Indeterminate form (e.g. `0 * Infinity`, `1 ** Infinity`, `Infinity / Infinity`, `Infinity - Infinity`)
- A method or expression whose operand is or gets coerced to `NaN` (e.g. `7 ** NaN`, `7 * "blabla"`) — this means `NaN` is contagious
- Other cases where an invalid value is to be represented as a number (e.g. an invalid Date `new Date("blabla").getTime()`, `"".charCodeAt(1)`)

## BigInt

`BigInt` is a special data type introduced to handle very large integers that exceed the limits of the Number type. `BigInt` enables precise representation and manipulation of integers that are larger than the maximum safe integer `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`.

There are two main ways to create a `BigInt` in JavaScript:

- Using the `BigInt` constructor.
- Using the `n` suffix.

```js
let bigIntValue1 = BigInt(1234567890123456789012345678901234567890);
let bigIntValue2 = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;
```

`BigInt` values are similar to `Number` values in some ways, but also differ in a few key matters: A `BigInt` value cannot be used with methods in the built-in Math object and cannot be mixed with a `Number` value in operations; they must be coerced to the same type. Be careful coercing values back and forth, however, as the precision of a `BigInt` value may be lost when it is coerced to a `Number` value.

<span style="color: SpringGreen;">BigInt is for integer calculations only. It cannot store decimals or perform floating-point arithmetic.</span>

Operators on it:

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, and modulus are supported. Division with BigInt always returns an integer.
- A BigInt value is not strictly equal to a Number value, but it is loosely so:

  ```js
  0n === 0; // false
  0n == 0; // true
  ```

- A `Number` value and a `BigInt` value may be compared as usual:

  ```js
  1n < 2; // true
  2n > 1; // true
  ```

<b><u>Example operations:</u></b>

```js
const previousMaxSafe = BigInt(Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER); // 9007199254740991n
const maxPlusOne = previousMaxSafe + 1n; // 9007199254740992n
const theFuture = previousMaxSafe + 2n; // 9007199254740993n, this works now!
const prod = previousMaxSafe * 2n; // 18014398509481982n
const diff = prod - 10n; // 18014398509481972n
const mod = prod % 10n; // 2n
const bigN = 2n ** 54n; // 18014398509481984n
bigN * -1n; // -18014398509481984n
const expected = 4n / 2n; // 2n
const truncated = 5n / 2n; // 2n, not 2.5n
```

## Strings

In JavaScript, the textual data is stored as strings. <span style="color: Cyan;">There is no separate type for a single character. Hence, it is immutable.</span> The internal format for strings is always UTF-16, it is not tied to the page encoding. UTF-16(16-bit Unicode Transformation Format) is a variable-length character encoding, which means that each character in a string may be represented by one or two code units. ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) and UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format - 8-bit) are both character encoding systems used to represent text in computers. The main difference between the two is the number of bits used to encode each character. Useful characters are same as ASCII only: <span style="color: Orange;">'a' to 'z' => 97 to 122, 'A' to 'Z' => 65 to 90, '0' to '9' => 48 to 57</span>. Refer the list here - https://www.charset.org/utf-8.

Strings can be enclosed within either single quotes, double quotes or backticks. Single and double quotes are essentially the same. Backticks, however, allow us to embed any expression into the string, by wrapping it in `${…}`:

```js
let single = "single-quoted";
let double = "double-quoted";

const sum = (a, b) => a + b;
console.log(`1 + 2 = ${sum(1, 2)}.`); // 1 + 2 = 3.
```

<div style="border: 2px solid Red; padding: 10px;">

Using the `spread operator (...)` on strings in JavaScript spreads the individual characters of the string into an array or other constructs where the spread operator is used.

```js
const str = "hello";
const charArray = [...str];

console.log(charArray); // ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
```

</div>
<br>

<h3><u>Playing with strings</u></h3>

- <b style="color: Salmon;">`str`.length</b>: Gives the length of the string excluding special characters like `\n`.
- <b style="color: Salmon;">`str`[`pos`]</b>: To get a character at position `pos` (it can be from `0` to `str.length - 1`).
- <b style="color: Salmon;">`str`.at(`pos`)</b>: Same as above but negative integers are allowed and they count back from the last string character.
- <b style="color: DarkCyan;">Looping through string</b>: `for..of` loop can be used to loop through string.

  ```js
  for (let char of "Hello") {
    console.log(char); // H,e,l,l,o (char becomes "H", then "e", then "l" etc)
  }
  ```

- <b style="color: DarkCyan;">Strings are immutable.</b> `str[0] = 'h';` will give error.
- <b style="color: Salmon;">`str`.codePointAt(`pos`)</b>: Returns a decimal number representing the code for the character at position `pos`. Example: `"0aA".codePointAt(0)` returns `48`.
- <b style="color: Salmon;">String.fromCodePoint(`code`)</b>: Creates a character by its numeric `code`.
- <b style="color: Salmon;">`str`.substring(`pos`, `len`)</b>: Returns the part of this string from the start index up to and excluding the end index, or to the end of the string if no end index is supplied.
- <b style="color: Salmon;">`str`.indexOf(`str2`, `pos`)</b>: looks for the `str2` in `str`, starting from the given position `pos`, and returns the position where the match was found or `-1` if nothing can be found.
- <b style="color: Salmon;">`str`.search(`str2` / `regex`, `pos`)</b>: Same as above with additional feature of allowing `regex` too.
- <b style="color: Salmon;">`str`.lastIndexOf(`str2`, `pos`)</b>: Does same as above but searches from end of string.
- <b style="color: Salmon;">`str`.includes(`str2`, `pos`)</b>: Returns `true/false` as per presence of string in `str` (<u>**NO REGEX**</u>).
- <b style="color: Salmon;">`str`.split(`separator`)</b>: Used to split a string into an array of substrings based on a specified separator. `"A B C".split(" ")` returns array - `["A", "B", "C"]`.
- <b style="color: Salmon;">`str`.replace(`str2` / `regex`, `str3`)</b>: Returns new string after replacing <u>**just first**</u> occurence of `str2` / `regex` with `str3`.
- <b style="color: Salmon;">`str`.replaceAll(`str2` / `regex`, `str3`)</b>: Returns a new string after replacing all occurences of `str2` / `regex` with `str3`.
- <b style="color: Salmon;">`str`.trim()</b>: Replaces white spaces from both ends of string.
- <b style="color: Salmon;">`str`.toLowerCase()</b> and <b style="color: Salmon;">`str`.toUpperCase()</b>: Returns string after converting it to lower (or upper) case.

## Symbols

A `Symbol` is a unique and immutable primitive data type introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015). It is primarily used as a key for object properties to ensure uniqueness and avoid property name conflicts.

<b><u>KEY FEATURES:</u></b>

1. <b style="color:Salmon;">Uniqueness:</b> Every `Symbol` is guaranteed to be unique, even if two symbols are created with the same description. Example:

   ```js
   const sym1 = Symbol("description");
   const sym2 = Symbol("description");
   console.log(sym1 === sym2); // false
   ```

2. <b style="color:Salmon;">Immutable:</b> Symbols are immutable and cannot be changed once created.
3. <b style="color:Salmon;">Non-Enumerable:</b> Symbol properties are not included in `for...in` loops or `Object.keys()` but can be accessed using methods like `Object.getOwnPropertySymbols()`.
4. <b style="color:Salmon;">Can't be converted to JSON:</b> Symbols are ignored when converting an object to JSON:

   ```js
   const obj = { [Symbol("key")]: "value" };
   console.log(JSON.stringify(obj)); // "{}"
   ```

<b><u>EXAMPLE USAGE:</u></b>

```js
const sym = Symbol("uniqueKey");

const obj = {
  [sym]: "value",
  name: "John",
};

console.log(obj[sym]); // "value"
console.log(obj.name); // "John"

// Symbol keys are not enumerable
console.log(Object.keys(obj)); // ["name"]
console.log(Object.getOwnPropertySymbols(obj)); // [Symbol(uniqueKey)]
```

<br>

# Type Conversions

In JavaScript, type conversions refer to the process of converting a value from one data type to another. There are two types of type conversions:

1. Implicit Type Conversion (Type Coercion)
2. Explicit Type Conversion (Type Casting)

<h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid white; padding-bottom: 2px; display: inline-block;">Implicit Type Conversion (Type Coercion)</h3>

Type coercion refers to the automatic conversion of values from one data type to another, typically performed during operations or comparisons involving different data types. By using Type Coercion, JavaScript attempts to make the data types compatible to complete the operation or comparison. For example, `alert` automatically converts any value to a string to show it. Mathematical operations convert values to numbers.

Examples:

```js
"5" + 2; // "52" (Number 2 is coerced to a string)
"5" - 2; // 3 (String '5' is coerced to a number)
true + 1; // 2 (true is coerced to 1)
false + 1; // 1 (false is coerced to 0)
null + 5; // 5 (null is coerced to 0)
undefined + 5; // NaN (undefined becomes NaN)
```

- **String Coercion in Concatenation (`+` operator):** The `+` operator is overloaded in JavaScript. It can perform both string concatenation and numeric addition. If either operand is a string, JavaScript will convert the other operand to a string and perform string concatenation.
- **Numeric Coercion in Mathematical Operations (`-`, `*`, `/`, `%`):** Operators like `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%` are used for numeric operations. JavaScript converts all operands to numbers before performing the operation.
- **Comparison Operators (`==`):** For `==`, JavaScript attempts to convert both sides to the same type before comparing. Use `===` to avoid type coercion, as it checks both type and value (strict equality).

  - If one operand is a string and the other is a number, JS converts the string to a number, then compares them. If the string cannot be converted to number, it will be converted to `NaN` and every comparision will yield `false`.
  - If one operand is a boolean, JS converts the boolean to a number (`true` becomes `1`, `false` becomes `0`), then compares them.
  - If one operand is an object and the other is a primitive (number, string, or boolean), JS attempts to convert the object to a primitive (usually via the object's `valueOf()` or `toString()` method).
  - If one is `null` and other is `undefined`, both are considered equal.

  ```js
  5 == "5"; // true (converts '5' to 5)
  0 == false; // true (converts false to 0)
  null == undefined; // true
  [1] == 1   // true (the array [1] is converted to the string "1", and then to the number 1)
  {} == "[object Object]"  // true (empty object is converted to its string representation)
  ```

- **Boolean contexts:** In contexts that expect a boolean (like `if` statements or the condition oprator), JavaScript converts values to `true` or `false`. Falsy values in JavaScript: `false`, `0`, `""`, `null`, `undefined`, `NaN` are all treated as `false`. Everything else is treated as `true` (truthy).

<h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid white; padding-bottom: 2px; display: inline-block;">Explicit Type Conversion (Type Casting)</h3>

In explicit type conversion, you intentionally convert a value from one type to another using JavaScript's built-in functions. Here are some common explicit type conversions:

- **String to Number:**

  ```js
  Number("123"); // 123
  Number("xyz"); // NaN
  ```

  <span style="color: Crimson;">JavaScript uses `NaN` (Not a Number) when a string or other type can't be properly converted to a number.</span> This simply indicates that a value is not a legal number. For example `3/0` will also return `NaN`. To check if a value is `NaN`, we use the <b style="color:Violet;">isNaN()</b> function. It converts the given value to a `Number` type, and then equates to `NaN`.

- **Number to String:**

  ```js
  let str = String(123); // "123"
  let str2 = (123).toString(); // "123"
  ```

- **Boolean to Number:**

  ```js
  let num = Number(true); // 1
  let num2 = Number(false); // 0
  ```

- **Number to Boolean:**

  ```js
  let bool = Boolean(1); // true
  let bool2 = Boolean(0); // false
  ```

# Nullish coalescing operator `??`

The nullish coalescing operator is written as two question marks `??`. The result of `a ?? b` is:

- if `a` is defined, then `a`,
- if `a` isn’t defined, then `b`.

In other words, `??` returns the first argument if it’s not `null/undefined`. Otherwise, the second one. The nullish coalescing operator isn’t anything completely new. It’s just a nice syntax to get the first “defined” value of the two. We can rewrite `result = a ?? b` using the operators that we already know, like this:

```js
result = a !== null && a !== undefined ? a : b;
```

The common use case for `??` is to provide a default value. For example, here we show user if its value isn’t `null/undefined`, otherwise `"Anonymous"`:

```js
let user;
alert(user ?? "Anonymous"); // Anonymous (user is undefined)
```

We can also use a sequence of `??` to select the first value from a list that isn’t `null/undefined`.

```js
let firstName = null;
let lastName = null;
let nickName = "Supercoder";

// shows the first defined value:
alert(firstName ?? lastName ?? nickName ?? "Anonymous"); // Supercoder
```

<h3 style="border-bottom: 2px solid white; padding-bottom: 2px; display: inline-block;">Comparison with OR operator</h3>

The `OR ||` operator can be used in the same way as `??`. For example, in the code above we could replace ?? with || and still get the same result. Historically, the `OR ||` operator was there first. It’s been there since the beginning of JavaScript, so developers were using it for such purposes for a long time. On the other hand, the `nullish coalescing operator ??` was added to JavaScript only recently, and the reason for that was that people weren’t quite happy with `||`.

The important difference between them is that:

- `||` returns the first truthy value.
- `??` returns the first defined value.

In other words, `||` doesn’t distinguish between `false`, `0`, an empty string `""` and `null/undefined`. They are all the same – falsy values. If any of these is the first argument of `||`, then we’ll get the second argument as the result.

# `instanceof` operator

The `instanceof` operator in JavaScript is used to check whether an object is an **instance** of a particular class or constructor function. It checks the **prototype** chain (of object) to determine if the object was created from the specified constructor.

**<u>SYNTAX</u>**

```js
object instanceof Constructor
```

- Returns `true` if object is an instance of Constructor (or a subclass).
- Returns `false` otherwise.

```js
console.log([] instanceof Array); // true
console.log({} instanceof Object); // true
console.log(() => {} instanceof Function); // true
console.log(new Date() instanceof Date); // true

function Car(make, model, year) {
  this.make = make;
  this.model = model;
  this.year = year;
}
const auto = new Car('Honda', 'Accord', 1998);

console.log(auto instanceof Car); // true

console.log(auto instanceof Object); // true
```

<br>

# `new` operator

The `new` operator lets developers create an instance of a user-defined object type or of one of the built-in object types that has a constructor function.

**<u>SYNTAX:</u>**

```js
new constructor;
new constructor();
new constructor(arg1);
new constructor(arg1, arg2);
new constructor(arg1, arg2, /* …, */ argN);
```

<span style="color: DarkSalmon;">constructor</span>: A class or function that specifies the type of the object instance. The expression can be anything with sufficient precedence, including an identifier, a property access, or another new expression, but optional chaining is not allowed.

<span style="color: DarkSalmon;">arg1, arg2, …, argN</span>: A list of values that the `constructor` will be called with. `new Foo` is equivalent to `new Foo()`, i.e. if no argument list is specified, `Foo` is called without arguments.

**<u>EXAMPLE:</u>**

```js
function Car(make, model, year) {
  this.make = make;
  this.model = model;
  this.year = year;
}

const car1 = new Car('Eagle', 'Talon TSi', 1993);

console.log(car1.make);
// Expected output: "Eagle"
```

**<u>DESCRIPTION:</u>**

When a function is called with the `new` keyword, the function will be used as a constructor. `new` will do the following things:

1. Creates a blank, plain JavaScript object. For convenience, let's call it `newInstance`.
2. Points `newInstance`'s `[[Prototype]]` to the constructor function's `prototype` property, if the `prototype` is an Object. Otherwise, `newInstance` stays as a plain object with `Object.prototype` as its `[[Prototype]]`.
3. Executes the `constructor` function with the given arguments, binding `newInstance` as the `this` context (i.e. all references to `this` in the constructor function now refer to `newInstance`).
4. If the constructor function returns a non-primitive, this return value becomes the result of the whole `new` expression. Otherwise, if the constructor function doesn't return anything or returns a primitive, `newInstance` is returned instead.

**<u>BULLET POINTS:</u>**

1. Classes can only be instantiated with the `new` operator — attempting to call a class without `new` will throw a `TypeError`.
2. While the constructor function can be invoked like any regular function (i.e. without the `new` operator), in this case a new object is not created and the value of `this` is also different.
3. A function can know whether it is invoked with `new` by checking `new.target`. `new.target` is only `undefined` when the function is invoked without `new`.
